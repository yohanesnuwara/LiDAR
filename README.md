# LiDAR Notebooks

Collection of tutorials that I wrote to open source the knowledge of processing LiDAR data using Python. The notebooks run on Google Colab, online free IDE with powerful computing resource by Google. 

Contents (and planned):

- Tutorial 01 Read point cloud data, clip with polygon, and visualize
- Tutorial 02 Create DSM, DTM, and CHM map
- Tutorial 03 Create aerial photo from point cloud
- Tutorial 04 Individual tree identification (planned)

PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library) is a powerful package for complex processing of LiDAR point cloud data in JSON pipeline. I have simplified the workflows so that it is easy to use.

Data used for these tutorials are open-source, such as:

- Borneo forest LiDAR data acquired by NASA Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). --> [Link](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1518) <--
